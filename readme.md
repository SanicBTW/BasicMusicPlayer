# This is something I wanted to do for a while, now that I've done it I might update it sometimes, also I could use this in order to learn HTML5 and that stuff.

I thought about adding some data (json) support but because funny html5 doesnt have the funny node js filesystem module i cant think of something to make it work :sob:
