# V2.2 Rewrite

(This update was made in almost 4 hours, lost my brain cells, proud of my work though)

*Making it compatible with mobile now

Huge thanks to [Bonndubz](https://github.com/bonndevoff) for the help

Changelog:

Improved settings UI

Added volume tray (Totally not inspired on Haxeflixel)

Added custom notifications (Yes I did this lol)

Rewrote the settings thingy, I thought modified settings were getting overwritten so I hardcoded it I guess

And funky animations lol

# Well that's everything for this update, next update will focus on bugfixes and that stuff, cya until then
