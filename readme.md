# V3.0 (EARLY RELEASE) Rewrite

## Beware of bugs

Huge thanks to [Bonndubz](https://github.com/bonndevoff) for the help

Changelog:

Rewrite the main page, using Ionic

Implement custom songs feature

UI is subject to change

Code is subject to change

No settings implemented yet

Notifications gone (For now, will add them again with Ionic design I guess, maybe not)

Volume bar gone too, will add it in the full release

# Issues

Song list might be under the player controls, might move them to the main menu (idk how to fix ui lol)

Pending some fixes to the song bar and that stuff
